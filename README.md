<li>The first script,I have developed 2 deep learning models to predict the rating of a coffee shop. One, is a baseline model using all default parameters and the other is a
tune model that I've made by tweaking the parameters.  </li>

<li>In the second script,above used Random Forest and GBM for developing models. In this script, I have created a random data set on my own and made two models. 
One that is a good model and the other model which has overfitted.  </li>

<li>The third script involved not only involved model development but data engineering as well. Before making the models I had to extract the day, year and month from a erroneous
string containing all the details. The based on various parameters, I was able to make a Stacked Ensemble that was able to predict the price of a house. This Stack Ensemble was made
of a GBM, Random Forest, Deep Learning and GLM models. The aim of the project was to create a model to predict the prices of house with RMSE < 123000 dollars. I was able to create
a model that predicted the price of house with RMSE = 113561 dollars. </li>
